<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>
  Many useful features of modern programming languages, such as
  anonymous functions (lambdas), generics, and ownership, have arisen
  out of research into the fundamentals of programming languages. This
  course will introduce students to those fundamentals: students will
  learn the tools and techniques used by programming languages
  researchers to model programs, type systems, and the design choices
  made in the creation of programming languages. There will be a
  particular focus on type systems, which provide many programming
  languages with a certain guarantee of runtime safety: usually that
  type errors will not occur at runtime, but more advanced type
  systems can guarantee information security, data-race-freedom and
  many other desirable properties. Students will see how type systems
  are designed, and how these safety properties of typed programs are
  proven. The course will also explore some applications of type
  systems in modern programming language research and practice.
</p>

  <p>
    <b>Prerequisites: </b>
    CS430 with a grade of C or better. If you have credit for CS440 or CS536
    but not CS430 and are interested in the class, contact the instructor.
  </p>

  <p>
Advanced undergraduate students are welcome to take this class, but
need permission to register.
  </p>

  <p><b>Textbook: </b>
    The lectures should be self-contained and notes will be provided, but
    much of the material will be drawn from the following book, which is
    recommended as a reference (there is an online preprint):<br /><br />
    Robert Harper, <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/pfpl/index.html"><i>Practical Foundations for Programming Languages
	(Second Edition)</i></a>,
    Cambridge, 2016. <br />
    <br />
    We may also take some topics from the following book, which is a useful
    reference (but probably not worth buying unless you think you will want
    to refer back to it later):<br /><br />
    Benjamin C. Pierce, <i>Types and Programming Languages</i>, MIT, 2002.
  </p>

  <p><b>Course Objectives:</b>
    After completing this class, students should be able to:
    <ul>
      <li>Understand the models, notations and techniques used by Programming
	Languages researchers to formalize languages and systems.</li>
      <li>Formally prove properties about programming languages and programs.</li>
      <li>Use the above techniques to design new type systems and models to
	formalize and prove properties about new and existing language features
	and systems.</li>
    <li>Read and understand professional literature in the field of Programming
      Languages.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Resources</h2>
  <h3>LaTeX resources</h3>
  <p>
  The use of LaTeX to typeset homework assignments is strongly encouraged, but
  not required. If you're not familiar with LaTeX, it has a bit of a learning
  curve but the time you take to learn it will definitely pay off over an
  academic career (and if you are/are planning to become a PhD student, it
  will become basically required at some point). Here are some resources
  to help you get up to speed.
  </p>
<p>
  I will try to provide LaTeX templates for at least the first few homeworks
  to help get you started too.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.overleaf.com">Overleaf</a>: A convenient online
      interface so you don't have to install anything.
    </li>
    <li>Overleaf also has a pretty good <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes">Learn LaTeX in 30 minutes</a>
      tutorial (I haven't verified their claim about how long it takes)
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html">Detexify</a>:
      Want to know how to typeset a particular math symbol? Draw it here
      and it'll give you the macro.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <a name="policies"></a>
<h2>Policies</h2>

<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>
Final grades will be based on the following:
<table border=0>
  <tr><td>35%</td><td>Homeworks (roughly 7 of them, and they may not be weighted equally)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>25%</td><td>Midterm Exam (Early March)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>35%</td><td>Final Exam (Final Exam Period)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>5%</td><td>Participation and Discussion</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>Final letter grades will be assigned at the instructor's discretion based
  on the difficulty of the homeworks and exams, which is difficult to predict
  before the semester starts. This should only help you and shouldn't be a
  source of stress (e.g., earning 90% based
  on the formula above will earn you an A, but if grades were lower than
  expected and I feel that students with lower final grades learned the
  material well enough to earn As also, I'll adjust accordingly).
</p>
<p>That said, my main grading policy is fairness: asking for a higher grade
  (without pointing to specific things that have been graded incorrectly)
  won't succeed, because that wouldn't be fair to the rest of the students.
  I understand that this is a required class for many students and there may
  be unpleasant consequences for earning less than a certain grade, however
  that absolutely cannot be a factor in your grade.
</p>

<h3>Attendance and Participation</h3>
<p>
  Sections 01 and 02 will meet on campus. Live
  attendance is encouraged; the ability to hear the material and ask
  questions live is valuable. Furthermore, class participation is an
  explicit (but small) part of your grade. I currently do not plan to
  formally take attendance and the occasional absence from lecture does not
  need to be excused. If you are in
  Section 01 or 02 and are consistently not able to come to lecture
  for some reason, discuss this with the instructor. I do not currently plan
  to livestream lectures, but they will be recorded.
</p>
<p>
  Section 03 is an online section; you will watch the lectures online at your
  leisure but complete the same assignments and exams as the in-person students.
  For classroom capacity reasons, Section 03 students <i>should not</i>
  attend in-person without the permission of the instructor.
</p>
  <p>
    There are many ways to get full credit for participation in class. For
    students in Sections 01 and 02, attending lecture and asking and answering
    questions is, of course, one. However, being an active participant (asking
    and answering questions) in discussions on Discord, and attending office
    hours are also good options for online students and students who are
    uncomfortable actively participating in the live lecture.
  </p>

<h3>PhD Qualifier section</h3>
<p>
PhD students who wish to use this course to satisfy the written qualifying
requirement must be enrolled in Section 02 (even if you are not able to
attend class in person; please let me know if this is the case, but I won't
hold it against you). Students in this section will complete the same
assignments and exams as the other sections, but may be graded to a different
standard.
</p>

<h3>Late Days/Late Work</h3>
<p>
  Each student has 8 "late days" to use on homeworks over the course of the
  semester. Using a late day extends the deadline by 24 hours. You do not
  need to let me know you're using late days; they'll be deducted automatically
  when you hand in the work.
</p>
<p>
  <i><b>Important:</b>
    No more than two late days may be used on any one assignment. Late days
    may not be used on exams.
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  After 48 hours, late work will not
  be accepted without the instructor's permission, which must be obtained
  <b>before</b> the deadline (and will be granted only
  for good reasons, e.g., medical emergencies).
</p>
<p>
  If you've used up your late days, work up to 2 days late (without prior
  permission from the instructor) will be accepted with
  a penalty of 10% per day.
</p>

<h3>Collaboration and Using Outside Sources</h3>
<p>
  All work submitted for credit (homework and exams) must be your own
  individual work. Some examples of violations of this policy are sharing
  answers with other students (this is a violation for <i>all</i> students
  involved, even if the answers were the original work of one of the students),
  and looking up answers to questions on the web.
  Note that these are just some examples, but not an exhaustive list.
<!--  , and using generative AI tools
  like ChatGPT<a href="#chat"><sup>*</sup></a> (note that these are just some e\
xamples, but not an exhaustive
  list). -->
</p>
<p>
  One exception is that you are free to get help from the instructor, TAs,
  and Illinois Tech's <a href="https://www.iit.edu/arc">Academic Resource Center</a>.
  These resources are here for you, and you can (and should!) use them if you
  need to. If you are working with a tutor outside of Illinois Tech or have
  a similar situation, please discuss the situation with the instructor as
  soon as possible and before submitting any work.
</p>
<p><i>Policy on generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT):</i> On most homework assignments
  (not exams), the use of these tools is allowed, but must be disclosed
  as follows. For any homework task where you used AI, you must say that you
  used it and describe how (even if you only used it to check your answer).
  In particular, mark (e.g., bold, highlight) any text that came directly from
  AI. If you used text from AI but edited it, say so and describe the edits
  (and/or include the original AI-generated text, but make it clear that this
  is not intended to be your answer). When possible, include
  the AI session logs. I will grade your assignment using exactly the same
  standards as non-AI-generated assignments (in particular, you are
  responsible for correcting any mistakes made by the AI).
  <b>Use of AI that is not disclosed or on tasks where it is not allowed
    is a violation of the academic honesty policy.</b>
</p>

<h3>Illinois Tech's Sexual Harassment and Discrimination Information</h3>
<p>Illinois Tech prohibits all sexual harassment, sexual misconduct,
and gender discrimination by any member of our community. This
includes harassment among students, staff, or faculty. Sexual
harassment of a student by a faculty member or sexual harassment of an
employee by a supervisor is particularly serious. Such conduct may
easily create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.
</p>

<p>
Illinois Tech encourages anyone experiencing sexual harassment or
sexual misconduct to speak with the Office of Title IX Compliance for
information on support options and the resolution process.
</p>

<p>
You can report sexual harassment electronically at
<a href="https://iit.edu/incidentreport">iit.edu/incidentreport</a>,
which may be completed anonymously. You may
additionally report by contacting the Title IX Coordinator, Virginia
Foster at <a href="mailto:foster@iit.edu">foster@iit.edu</a>
or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator at
<a href="mailto:eespeland@iit.edu">eespeland@iit.edu</a>.
</p>

<p>
For confidential support, you may reach Illinois Tech's Confidential
Advisor at (773) 907-1062. You can also contact a licensed
practitioner in Illinois Tech's Student Health and Wellness Center at
<a href="mailto:student.health@iit.edu">student.health@iit.edu</a>
or (312)567-7550.
