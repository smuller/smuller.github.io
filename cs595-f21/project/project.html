  <h1>CS595 Applications in PL Final Project</h1>

  <h2>General Info</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The project may be done in groups of 1-3 students. Expectations for the
      scope of the project will be scaled according to group size, so smaller
      groups aren't at a disadvantage.</li>
    <li>The goal of the project is to apply the tools and techniques learned
      in the class to a domain of interest to you, whether that's your
      research, another interest in CS or an interest outside of CS.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Project Scope</h3>
  <p>
  (Added 11/1) At this point, your group has discussed project ideas with
  Stefan at least once and you should have some general ideas of what
  project-specific results to include.
  As a broad guideline, each project should include:
  <ul>
    <li>A definition of a model for some language, system or idea
      (syntax defining the language for your model, as well as rules for
      one or more judgments, which might include typing rules, operational
      semantics, cost semantics and others).
    </li>
    <li>At least one proof, roughly on the scale of the progress/preservation
      you've been doing for homework, that shows that your model "makes sense".
      For a language, this might be a proof of type safety (progress and
      preservation). Or it may be something else.
    </li>
  </ul>
  If you're having doubts as to how these guidelines apply to your particular
  project, talk to Stefan.
  </p>

  <h2>Project Ideas</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Model the syntax and semantics of an existing language or system and
      develop a type system to rule out some class of "bad" programs
      (<i>Examples:</i> the division by zero type system from HW1)
    </li>
    <li> Develop a syntax and semantics to model something that isn't a
      (conventional) programming language, and prove something interesting
      about it (this could involve developing a type system as in Idea 1,
      but doesn't need to).
      (<i>Examples:</i> the model of red-black trees and corresponding proof
      from HW0, <a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/disneyresearch/wp-content/uploads/20160705213118/A-Compiler-for-3D-Machine-Knitting-Paper.pdf">this paper</a>)
    </li>
    <li> Extend a language model from a paper (add features,
      rule out more "bad" programs, allow more "good" programs, etc.)
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    If you have other ideas that you think would make a good project in line
    with the goals of the class, talk to Stefan.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're looking for inspiration or aren't sure what fits within this,
    any of the papers linked under the "Applications" section of the
    course site would make an A+ final project (keep in mind, of course, that
    most of these are published conference papers, so are more thorough
    than would be expected for a final project.)
  </p>
    

  <h2>Timeline/Deadlines</h2>
  <p>These are highly subject to change.</p>

  <p>Late days may be used on the proposal and final paper. Note that for group
    projects, late days will be charged to everyone in the group with late
    days remaining (that is, you can still use late days as long as anyone
    in the group has late days remaining, but you can't pool them.)

  <h2>Deliverables</h2>

  More details on each of these will be announced as they get closer.
  <a name="idea"></a>
  <h3>Initial Idea</h3>
  <b>Due:</b> Oct. 13, 11:59pm CT.
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>Find a group for the final project (or decide to work alone).</li>
      <li>Schedule a meeting (for your whole group)
	with Stefan to discuss the idea.</li>
      <li>Submit 2-3 paragraphs (as a group)
	describing the idea for your project.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    The submission doesn't need to be very formal but should
    indicate some thought about what you plan to do and how you plan
    to relate it to the course topic. For example, if you're solving a
    problem in a language or system, describe the language or system and
    explain the problem.
    If you're modeling something outside of CS, talk about the thing,
    what features of it you plan to model, and some ideas for what you
    plan to say/prove about the model.
    If you're planning to extend a paper, cite and summarize the paper
    and talk briefly about your idea for an extension.
  </p>
  <p>
    The submission won't be graded; you get full credit by submitting
    something reasonable by the deadline.
  </p>

  <a name="proposal"></a>
  <h3>Proposal</h3>
  <b>Due:</b> Nov. 11, 11:59pm CT.

  <p>
    Your proposal should be approximately 1-3 pages and formatted like a
    research proposal with at least the following general outline.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li> Introduction
      <ul>
	<li>Motivate the problem your project aims to solve; why is it
	  important?</li>
	<li>Give an overview of your proposed solution.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Preliminary Work
      <ul>
	<li>Describe any work you've already done toward building your model:
	  if you have any (rough draft) syntax or rules, present it here.
	</li>
	<li>The focus should be on the text description of what you've done
	  and how it achieves your goals, not the low-level technical details
	  of how you've accomplished it (intuition behind your syntax/rules and
	  examples are great!)
	</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Proposed Work
      <ul>
	<li>Outline what is left to be done.</li>
	<li>Give rough statements of theorems/lemmas you plan to prove.
	  Perhaps describe at a high level how you might go about proving
	  them.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Timeline and Research Plan
      <ul>
	<li>Give a (roughly) week-by-week timeline of when you plan to
	  accomplish each of the goals of the proposed work.</li>
	<li><b>For group projects, describe who is going to do what.</b></li>
	<li>Example: "(Week of Nov. 15) Group members A and B are going to
	  work together to flesh out the operational semantics.
	  (Week of Nov. 22) B will prove Theorem 1.
	  (Week of Nov. 29) A and B will make slides for the class presentation
	  (Dec. 2-Dec. 6) A will prove Theorem 2, B will begin writing up the
	  other results.
	  (Dec. 6-Dec. 8) A will write up Theorem 2, A and B will polish the
	  writing of hte paper."
	</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
	  
	 

  <a name="paper"></a>
  <h3>Final Paper</h3>
  <b>Due:</b> Dec. 8, 11:59pm CT.

  <p>
    Your final paper should be in the format of an ACM research paper, with
    some modifications detailed below. This
    guarantees that everyone's paper will be in the same form and page limits,
    etc., will be fair. ACM provides their own LaTeX class
    file (as well as a Word template if you prefer to use that).
    Information about the ACM class file and Word template is on
    <a href = "https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">the
      ACM's website</a>.
    If you use Overleaf, this page has details about how to use the ACM
    class on Overleaf.
    If you're using LaTeX (locally or on Overleaf),
    I put together a <a href="template.zip">template</a>
    that has everything you should need.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'll discuss the format and how to write a research paper in more detail
    in class, but here are some highlights and differences from a standard
    research paper.
  </p>
  <p>
    You should have:
    <ul>
      <li>An introduction, much like the intro of your proposal.</li>
      <li>One or more sections that discuss your contribution in a readable,
	user-friendly way:
	<ul>
	  <li>Give all of the formal grammars, definitions, judgments, rules,
	    proofs, etc., needed to know what you did, but for each block
	    of formal mathematical notation, <i>also explain</i>
	    what it means/does
	    in plain English.
	  </li>
	  <li>Give examples to help illustrate how your model works, how to
	    use it, etc.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	A conclusion.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    In contrast to most standard published research papers, you <i>don't</i>
    need:
    <ul>
      <li>An abstract</li>
      <li>A discussion of related papers</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Your paper should be a <b>maximum</b> (<i>not</i> minimum) of 10 pages
    in the ACM format. If you really need more space, let me know why and
    I may make an exception.
    There's no minimum page limit, but make sure you fully describe your
    project and give all of the examples, intuitions, etc., you feel are needed.
  </p>

  <h3>For Writing Help</h3>
  <p>The IIT Writing Center (see blurb below) is a useful resource if you're
    looking for more guidance or feedback on your proposal or final paper.
    The tutors there should be able to help you.
    Full disclosure: One of them (<a href="https://sites.google.com/andrew.cmu.edu/hringler">Hannah</a>) is Stefan's fiancee.
  </p>
  <p>
  Consider using the campus writing center as a resource for help with
  written assignments like research papers, technical reports, or
  presentations. The writing center provides one-on-one conferences
  for both undergraduate and graduate students. Tutors can assist with
  any stage in the writing process, from brainstorming and outlining
  to final edits and bibliographies. Tutors read academic writing with
  a critical eye given not only to grammar and syntax, but also to
  understanding assignments, paragraph structure, clarity of ideas,
  strategies for revision, and even strengthening arguments. Visit
  here to make a (free!) appointment:

  <h2>Grading</h2>
  <p>
    Final project grades will be based on the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Initial idea (full credit if submitted on time).</li>
      <li>Proposal</li>
      <li>Applicability to course</li>
      <li>Appropriate scope for size of group</li>
      <li>Correctness of proofs</li>
