<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>
Type systems provide many programming languages with a certain
guarantee of runtime safety, usually that type errors will not occur
at runtime. More advanced and exotic type systems can guarantee more
interesting properties of programs, and are used in active research to
guarantee information security, resource (e.g., time, energy, space)
usage bounds, safety properties of concurrent programs and even to
prove complex mathematical theorems. This course will teach the formal
theory underlying the study of programming languages and, in
particular, type systems, and the techniques that are used to prove
properties of programming languages. We will also explore interesting
applications of type systems in modern research, including some drawn
from those above and others based on students' interest and research.
</p>
<p>
Students will complete a final project in which they design a type
system or language model (or extension of an existing one) to solve an
interesting problem related to their own research or other interests.
</p>

  <p>
    <b>Prerequisites: </b>
There are no formal prerequisites beyond mathematical sophistication
and experience programming in any statically typed programming
language (e.g., C/C++, Rust, Java, Haskell, ML). In addition,
experience with functional programming will be helpful but not
required.
</p>

  <p>
Advanced undergraduate students are welcome to take this class, but
may require permission to register.
  </p>

  <p><b>Textbook: </b>
There is <i>no required textbook</i> for the class.
  </p>
  <p>
For students wanting a reference and additional depth into some of the material,
the following books may be useful, but there is no need to buy one for
the class.<br />
Robert Harper, <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/pfpl/index.html"><i>Practical Foundations for Programming Languages
(Second Edition)</i></a>,
Cambridge, 2016. <br />
Benjamin C. Pierce, <i>Types and Programming Languages</i>, MIT, 2002.
</p>

  <p><b>Course Objectives:</b>
    After taking this class, students should be able to:
    <ul>
      <li> Understand the models, notations and
  techniques used by Programming Languages researchers to formalize
  languages and systems
      <li> Formally prove properties about programming languages and programs
      <li> Use the above techniques to design new type systems
  and models to formalize and prove properties about their favorite
  language features and systems 
      <li> Read and understand a research paper in the field of
  Programming Languages
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Applications</h2>
  <p>
  This course is largely about applying programming language techniques
  (which you'll learn in the first ~2/3 of the class) to solve problems in
  other areas. Your paper presentation and your final project will focus on
  these applications. Here are some ways people have applied PL techniques
  to solve other problems (both inside and outside of computer science!)
  for inspiration.
  </p>
  <p>
    When thinking about your own application for your project, you should
    feel neither constrained to pick something from this list nor forbidden
    from picking something already on the list. These are only examples. I'd
    encourage you to pick something related to your own interests (CS or non-CS)
    and/or research (if you're doing research). If you're having trouble
    figuring out how to connect an interest to PL, we'll discuss it and try
    to figure something out!
  </p>
  <p>
    The linked papers will be quite difficult to read at first; hopefully
    over the first part of the class, you'll find them easier. However,
    we still may not learn all of the techniques and notations used in these
    papers in the class. If you'd really like to understand one of these
    papers and still find it difficult, I'd be happy to discuss it!

  <a name="policies"></a>
<h2>Policies</h2>

<h3>Attendance/COVID</h3>
<p>
  The plan is for this class to meet in person, as discussion and participation
  will be important for the nature of the class. Remote participation can be
  arranged with the instructor if necessary for particular classes (e.g., if
  quarantine restrictions, etc., prevent you from being on campus for an
  extended period of time). The course modality (in-person/online) and
  schedule are of course, subject to possible change based on changes in
  IIT or Chicago policies.
</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>
Final grades will be based on the following:
<table border=0>
  <tr><td>40%</td><td>Homeworks (3-4, in the first ~2/3 of the class)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>20%</td><td>Paper Presentation</td></tr>
  <tr><td>30%</td><td>Final Project</td></tr>
  <tr><td>10%</td><td>Participation/Discussion</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<!--
<p>Final letter grades will be assigned at the instructor's discretion based
  on the difficulty of the homeworks and exams, which is difficult to predict
  before the semester starts. This should only help you and shouldn't be a
  source of stress (e.g., barring exceptional circumstances, earning 90% based
  on the formula above should earn you an A, but if grades were lower than
  expected and I feel that students with lower final grades learned the
  material well enough to earn As also, I'll adjust accordingly).
</p>
<p>That said, my main grading policy is fairness: asking for a higher grade
  (without pointing to specific things that have been graded incorrectly)
  won't succeed, because that wouldn't be fair to the rest of the students.
</p>
-->



<h3>Late Days/Late Work</h3>
<p>
  Each student has 4 "late days" to use on homeworks over the course of the
  semester. Using a late day extends the deadline by 24 hours. You do not
  need to let me know you're using late days; they'll be deducted automatically
  when you hand in the work.
</p>
<p>
  <i><b>Important:</b>
    No more than two late days may be used on any one assignment. Late days may
    not be used on the paper presentation or the final project.
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  After 48 hours, or if you have used up your late days, late work will not
  be accepted without the instructor's permission (and will be granted only
  for good reasons, e.g., medical emergencies).
</p>


<h3>Collaboration</h3>
<p>
  Homeworks are to be completed individually.
  Discussing general course concepts with other students to get a better
  understanding is permitted (and encouraged!). More specific discussions
  about homework questions is permitted as long as:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Discussion is two-way: it's not just one person giving the other help.
    </li>
    <li>Discussion is at the level of concepts and general strategies (e.g.,
      an approach to solving a problem), not specific answers or proofs.
    </li>
    <li>All students involved write up their solutions independently.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  Policies for the paper presentation and final project are still TBD, but
  it is likely working with a partner/team will be allowed.
  </p>


<h3>Illinois Tech's Sexual Harassment and Discrimination Information</h3>
<p>Illinois Tech prohibits all sexual harassment, sexual misconduct,
and gender discrimination by any member of our community. This
includes harassment among students, staff, or faculty. Sexual
harassment of a student by a faculty member or sexual harassment of an
employee by a supervisor is particularly serious. Such conduct may
easily create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.
</p>

<p>
Illinois Tech encourages anyone experiencing sexual harassment or
sexual misconduct to speak with the Office of Title IX Compliance for
information on support options and the resolution process.
</p>

<p>
You can report sexual harassment electronically at
<a href="https://iit.edu/incidentreport">iit.edu/incidentreport</a>,
which may be completed anonymously. You may
additionally report by contacting the Title IX Coordinator, Virginia
Foster at <a href="mailto:foster@iit.edu">foster@iit.edu</a>
or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator at
<a href="mailto:eespeland@iit.edu">eespeland@iit.edu</a>.
</p>

<p>
For confidential support, you may reach Illinois Tech's Confidential
Advisor at (773) 907-1062. You can also contact a licensed
practitioner in Illinois Tech's Student Health and Wellness Center at
<a href="mailto:student.health@iit.edu">student.health@iit.edu</a>
or (312)567-7550.
